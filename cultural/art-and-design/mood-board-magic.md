# Mood Board Magic

---

## Event Description

Mood Board Magic is an expressive painting competition that challenges participants to visually interpret and capture a specific mood or emotion assigned to them. Using paint and any medium of their choice, artists create original compositions that translate feelings into color, form, and abstract imagery. The event encourages:
- Exploration of color theory
- Emotional expression
- Creative interpretation

Participants are pushed to communicate complex ideas non-verbally through their art, celebrating the power of visual storytelling and the diverse ways mood can be depicted on canvas.
