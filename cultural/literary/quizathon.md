## Rules and Regulations
### Prelims (Written Round)
- Purpose: Filter top teams for the stage round (pounce and bounce mains).
- Format: 20–30 questions (may vary), written format, one consolidated answer sheet per team.
- Scoring: Typically +1 (or +10) for correct, no negatives. No passing/pouncing. Top 8–12 teams qualify for finals/mains.

### Mains (Pounce and Bounce Format)
1. **Pounce**
	- Question posed to one team, but all teams can attempt by "pouncing" (write answer quickly and submit within 10–15 seconds).
	- Correct pounce: full points. Wrong pounce: negative score (commonly −5).
	- Once a team pounces, they cannot attempt the question again if it comes to them later.
2. **Bounce**
	- If no one pounces (or after pounces are resolved), the question continues in normal “bounce” format.
	- The team to whom the question was originally directed gets first chance to answer.
	- If they fail, the question “bounces” to other teams until answered or all pass.
	- Only the answering team in bounce gets positive points (no negatives).
