## Event Description

Canvas Relay is an innovative art competition that showcases collaborative creativity through a relay format. Multiple teams work consecutively on the same canvas, starting from a partially completed artwork based on themes such as sustainability, mythology, or future cities. After a fixed time, the canvas is passed to the next team, which builds on the previous design with its own style and techniques.

This process continues until the final team completes the piece, resulting in a unified masterpiece that reflects diverse perspectives. The event challenges participants to:
- Adapt quickly
- Maintain thematic harmony
- Think creatively under time constraints

Canvas Relay is a true celebration of teamwork, innovation, and artistic vision.
