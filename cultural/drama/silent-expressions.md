## Event Description

Silent Expressions (Miming) is a silent performance art where actors convey emotions, actions, and stories using only body movements, facial expressions, and gestures. Without words or sound, it relies on exaggerated physicality to communicate with the audience. This expressive form of storytelling captivates by turning invisible objects and scenarios into vivid, imaginative experiences.
